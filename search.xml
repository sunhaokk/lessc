Sinatra Bootstrap - 一个 支持Haml, Sass, Compass, jQuery 等 的Sinatra项目. nanocnanoc 是一个用 Ruby 实现的静态网页产生工具 最小集成: 只需要拖他进去 最简单的途径集成compass到nanoc. 更改 config.rb 指向到你所使用的样式表. 你需要单独运行一个窗口用Compass watch命令监控编译nanoc程序. 实力项目，如: unthinkingly. 标准集成 Nanoc文件规范的首要要点, 像这样加载 Compass 配置文件:1234567require 'compass'Compass.add_project_configuration 'compass.rb'# when using Compass &gt; 0.10sass_options = Compass.sass_engine_options# when using Compass &gt; 0.10Compass.configuration.parse 'compass.rb' when using Compass &lt; 0.10sass_options = Compass.config.to_sass_engine_options when using Compass &lt; 0.10 创建并配置一个 compass.rb 文件到你站点的根目录 .示例配置:1234567891011http_path = "/"project_path = File.expand_path(File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '..'))css_dir = "output/stylesheets"sass_dir = "content/stylesheets"images_dir = "assets/images"javascripts_dir = "assets/javascripts"fonts_dir = "assets/fonts"http_javascripts_dir = "javascripts"http_stylesheets_dir = "stylesheets"http_images_dir = "images"http_fonts_dir = "fonts" 根据您的目录结构和配置，您可能需要更改一些目录的路径。1234567Sass 和 Compass过滤样式表, 从Compass按照配置好的sass引擎，调用sass进行过滤, 如下: compile '/stylesheets/*' do filter :sass, sass_options.merge(:syntax =&gt; item[:extension].to_sym) end nanoc projects using the formal approach 站点 最佳方法按下面的方法可以使你的项目更以维护和创建. 使用一个Base样式表文件 创建一个_base.scss partial(部分) 用来初始化样式表中共同的变量和集成一些你经常使用的工具。 _base.scss12345678$blueprint-grid-columns : 24;$blueprint-grid-width : 30px;$blueprint-grid-margin : 10px;$font-color :333;@import "compass/reset";@import "compass/utilities";@import "blueprint"; // etc._base.scss 同时也是储存你自定义 mixins(混合)的好地方, 所以它可以供任何样式表用。 你可以在其他样式表中包含它: application.scss 12345@import &quot;base&quot;;#wrapper &#123; @include container;&#125; // etc.如果你想覆盖掉base.scss,可以在@import-ing之前，定义一些compass/framework 常量. 请参见可配置的变量里具体的例子. 请注意，您可以参考 base.scss的，因为它是局部的,所以名字没有前置下划线和扩展名。(译者注:这里意思就是partial是公共部分，不属于私有，所以起名字的时候不要加或者扩展名) 编写自定义Mixins Mixins让你通过一条命令就可以把多个样式表插入选择器. 这样可以使你的源码避免重复，提升可维护性. 使用mixins让你的样式表源码像自己注释的文档 – 这样更易读，例如 @include round-corners(6px,f00) 要比列出多条语句强很多。 自由标记样式表 从一个站点的页面中提取出我们所关注的css样式. 这样看似更易于维护. 然而, 事实上, 由于CSS功能上的限制抽象成符合DRY原则的可维护的代码. 不过sass它能让我们能够创建完全抽象和重用的代码，允许我们把所有的样式移入到样式表里。 读这篇博客关于这个问题的更多信息 一旦你有整洁的标记，使用mixin和继承的样式表。整洁清晰的抽象，您应该能够阅读网页的样式表,甚至没有在Web浏览器中加载该页,就想象出页面会是什么样子。 如果你发现语义化的选择器使得你的css表臃肿，是时候到重构的时间了，例如，此样式表将产生不必要的膨胀: 1234567891011@mixin three-column &#123; .container &#123; @include container; &#125; .header, .footer &#123; @include column(24); &#125; .sidebar &#123; @include column(6); &#125; article &#123; @include column(10); &#125; .rightbar &#123; @include column(8); &#125;&#125;body#article,body#snippet,body#blog-post &#123; @include three-column; &#125; 相反的，问问自己，“这些页面非样式的实质共同点是什么？”在这种情况下，他们的所有内容页面，最好把这些页面的body类单独编辑。(译者注，上面的sass样式表，编写完很臃肿冗余的。这把所有页面的内容都合并在了一起。产生太多没必要的语句。所以为了省代码，不如单独写更易于维护) 嵌套选择器不要太多层。 从零开始进行样式处理或以应用程序的一些常见的基点，要比应付不想要的风格到您的新设计的容易多。这样，在标记书中使用一些选择器，最好使用一些基本嵌套样式。然后使用重构模式的出现，减少膨胀。 重要的是过长嵌套的选择器会导致一个小渲染的性能损失，可以减缓您的Web页面。没有必要完全模仿你的css文档结构。嵌套只有足够深的选择器是唯一的部分。例如，不要使用table thead tr th，当一个简单th选择器时就足够了。这可能意味着你必须把你的风格分成若干选择器，让文档级联工作。 ContributingContributing Stylesheets to CompassThank you for your interest in contributing to Compass. Our goal is to make it as easy as we can for you to contribute changes to compass – So if there’s something here that seems harder than it ought to be, please let us know. If you find a bug in this document, you are bound to contribute a fix. Stop reading now if you do not wish to abide by this rule. Step 1: If you do not have a github account, create one. Step 2: Fork Compass to your account. Go to the main repo and click the fork button. Fork Me Now we’re at a decision point. What kind of change do you intend to make? Fix a typo (or some other trivial change)Documentation ChangesFixing Stylesheet BugsNew Stylesheet FeaturesRuby ChangesHere’s some general information about the project you might find useful along the way: Submitting PatchesProject StructureGeneral PhilosophyStylesheet ConventionsMiscellaneous StuffSetting up GitUsing Compass while Under DevelopmentRunning TestsRecovering from a cherry-pick or a rebase Making Trivial ChangesThanks to Github, making small changes is super easy. After forking the project navigate to the file you want to change and click the edit link. Edit Me Change the file, write a commit message, and click the Commit button. Commit Me Now you need to get your change accepted. Making Documentation ChangesThe compass documentation is stored in two places. First, the compass-style.org directory is where the documentation lives – however much of the documentation is generated from comments in the Sass files themselves. More information on changing documentation. Once your changes are pushed, please submit them. Fixing Stylesheet BugsStep 3: If this is a bug you discovered. Please report it before working on a fix. This helps us better understand the patch. Step 4: Get the code if you haven’t yet done so. Step 5: Fix the bug and commit the changes. Please make sure to mention the bug id in your commit message like so: Fixed the display of the fizzlebuzz in IE6. Closes GH-123.Step 6: Verify the fix in as many browsers as you can as well as against your own project. How to use compass while changing it. Step 7: Make sure the tests pass. More info on running tests If the tests fail, fix the tests or the stylesheets accordingly. If the tests, don’t fail, that means this aspect was not well enough tested. Please add or augment a test. You’re done. Please submit your changes. Making Stylesheet ChangesIt is a good idea to discuss new features ideas with the compass users and developers before building something. Please don’t be shy; send an email to the compass mailing list. Many feature ideas are good but not obviously a good fit for the compass core library. In these cases, you can and should create a compass extension. Sometimes this is because the concept does not align with the compass philosophy. But sometimes it’s just because we think the idea needs time to bake. Documentation on making extensions. Step 3: Get the code if you haven’t yet done so. Step 4: Add the feature – contact the mailing list if you have any questions. Step 5: Add a test case. More info on writing tests for compass. Step 6: Documentation - Add or update the reference documentation. Add an example of using the feature. See the doc readme for details. You’re done. Please submit your changes. Making Ruby ChangesAt this time, if you’re a rubyist who’s planning on working on the ruby-side of things, it’s assumed you know how to read code and use standard ruby tools like rake, gem, bundler, test/unit, cucumber, rspec, etc. If you have any questions, please ask. No changes will be accepted without accompanying tests. Submitting PatchesIf you are submitting features that have more than one changeset, please create a topic branch to hold the changes while they are pending merge and also to track iterations to the original submission. To create a topic branch: $ git checkout -b new_branch_name… make more commits if needed …$ git push origin new_branch_nameYou can now see these changes online at a url like: http://github.com/your_user_name/compass/commits/new_branch_nameIf you have single-commit patches, it is fine to keep them on master. But do keep in mind that these changesets might be cherry-picked. Once your changeset(s) are on github, select the appropriate branch containing your changes and send a pull request. Make sure to choose the same upstream branch that you developed against (probably stable or master). Most of the description of your changes should be in the commit messages – so no need to write a whole lot in the pull request message. However, the pull request message is a good place to provide a rationale or use case for the change if you think one is needed. More info on pull requests. Pull Request ExamplePull requests are then managed like an issue from the compass issues page. A code review will be performed by a compass core team member, and one of three outcomes will result: The change is rejected – Not all changes are right for compass’s philosophy. If your change is rejected it might be better suited for a plugin, at least until it matures and/or proves itself with the users.The change is rejected, unless – Sometimes, there are missing pieces, or other changes that need to be made before the change can be accepted. Comments will be left on the commits indicating what issues need to be addressed.The change is accepted – The change is merged into compass, sometimes minor changes are then applied by the committer after the merge.

General PhilosophyUsers specify their own selectors. Compass never forces a user to use a presentational class name.Compass does not require javascript. It is a CSS framework.Compass core is “design agnostic”. This is why compass core has no grid framework – grids are not design agnostic.Compass frameworks are not special. If compass can do it, so should an extension be able.Sass is awesome – Compass should make sass more accessible and demonstrate how to use Sass to its fullest potential.Developing across browsers is hard and will always be hard. It takes a community to get it right.By default, Compass supports as many browsers as it can. Where it can’t it progressively enhances. Where it degrades, the documentation should make a note. Deviation from this requires an excellent reason.Compass is a proving ground for Sass features. The watcher and color functions are examples of features that started in Compass and got moved to Sass. Stylesheet ConventionsAll framework stylesheets are partials. Their filename begin with an underscore. Otherwise, Sass will create stylesheets directly into the user’s CSS directory.Compass imports do not emit styles. There are a few limited exceptions to this like the resets and base classes for inheritance.Mixins with two-level defaults. Mixins often provide two levels of default values. The first is a global default that can be overridden once. The second is a default that can be overridden when the mixin is included.Mixin argument names are part of the public API, make sure they are understandable and not needlessly truncated or terse.If adding a new folder of stylesheets, add a single stylesheet with the same name that imports all of the stylesheets in the folder.Try to avoid passing selectors as arguments. This is what mixins are for. Common Problems &amp; Miscellaneous InfoSetting up Git Please follow these instructions to set up your email address and attribution information. Download your git repo: git clone git@github.com:your_username/compass.gitSet up a remote to the main repo: cd compassgit remote add chriseppstein git://github.com/chriseppstein/compass.gitGetting recent changes from the main repo: git fetch chriseppstein Using Compass while Under DevelopmentUse the bin script. /path/to/compass/bin/compass is a version of the compass command line that uses the local changes you have made. You can add /path/to/compass/bin to your $PATH, or refer to it directly.Build and install a gem:Edit VERSION and change the version to something like: 1.0.0.something-unique-to-me.0gem build compass.gemspecgem install compass-0.10.6.something-uniq-to-me.0.gem – If installing to your system gems, you’ll probably need to add sudo to the front. If you don’t know what that means, you probably need to add sudo to the front.In a bundled environment, you can configure your gem to use compass while you work on it like so: gem ‘compass’, :path =&gt; “/Users/myusername/some/path/to/compass”Bundler will perform some sort of charm on ruby to make it work. Configuring ruby directly. If you’re a ruby pro, you probably don’t need to be told that you can set compass on the load path like so: export RUBYLIB=/Users/myusername/some/path/to/compass/lib Running TestsYou must have Ruby installed on your system. After setting up git, change to the root directory of your git checkout of Compass. cd compassInstall the bundler Ruby gem. gem install bundlerIf installing to your system gems, you’ll probably need to add sudo to the front of that command. If you don’t know what that means, you probably need to add sudo to the front. Install development dependencies: bundle install –binstubs devbinRunning core library and stylesheet tests: bundle exec rake test featuresRunning behavior tests ./devbin/cucumberIf stylesheet tests fail, the output of the test project is captured in test/fixtures/stylesheets//saved/ and the error message will report where the error was. Here’s an example: Stylesheet Test Failure Writing Stylesheet TestsCompass has stylesheet tests to ensure that each stylesheet compiles, can be imported directly without any other dependencies and that refactorings that should not affect the output, don’t. At some point, it would be great to have a test system that verifies that the stylesheets work correctly in various browsers. If you have ideas for how to accomplish this in a sane way, please let us know. In the test/fixtures/stylesheets directory, there are a number of compass projects. The tests work by adding or updating the sass files, running the tests to make sure they fail, and then changing the expected css output to make the test pass. It is rudimentary, but as a safety net, it has caught a number of problems that might have been missed otherwise. If you add a new stylesheet to compass, please make sure to add a new test stylesheet that only imports the newly added stylesheet and add rules that use the new features in that stylesheet. You cherry-picked/rebased my changes. What should I do?Depending on any number of reasons, including but not limited to the alignment of the stars, Your changes might not be merged into compass using a simple merge. For instance, we might decide to place a change against master into stable instead, or we might squish all your changes together into a single commit at the time of merge, or we might want a change you’ve submitted but not a change that it was placed onto top of. In these cases, there are a couple of ways you can react: If you have some changes on a branch that were not yet accepted, but other changes on that branch were accepted then you should run the following command (make sure to fetch first): git checkout branch_name; git rebase chriseppstein/master (assuming the change was applied to the master branch)If all your changes on the topic branch were accepted or you don’t care to keep it around anymore: git checkout master; git branch -D branch_name; git push origin :branch_name Creating Compass ExtensionsExtending CompassProduction StylesheetsSpritingCustomizationMagic SelectorsSprite layoutsTestingUpgradingLemonade UpgradeScared to Upgrade?Upgrading to v0.11Working with Configurable VariablesExamplesDocumentationSupportBugs]]></content>
